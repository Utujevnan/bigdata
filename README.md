# Uber Fare Data Analysis Project

##  Introduction

This project analyzes Uber ride fare data using Python for data preparation and Power BI for visual insights.

The goal is to understand ride patterns, fare behaviors, and time-based trends by cleaning, transforming, and visualizing a real-world dataset.

Key questions explored include:
- What time of day are Uber rides most frequent?
- How does fare amount relate to time, distance, or day of the week?
- Are there clear peak and off-peak patterns?

This project combines data cleaning, feature engineering, and dashboard design to deliver useful insights.

## Methodology

The analysis followed these major steps:

1. Loaded the Uber Fares dataset into Python using Pandas.
2. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand structure, types, and quality.
3. Cleaned the dataset by removing nulls and unnecessary columns.
4. Created new features (hour, day, weekday, peak hours).
5. Exported the cleaned/enhanced dataset for Power BI.
6. Built charts and dashboards in Power BI to explore key patterns.

##  Analysis

- Most rides occurred during peak morning and evening hours.
- Fare amounts tended to increase during high-traffic hours.
- Distance showed a strong correlation with fare amount.
- Weekends had slightly different ride behavior than weekdays.
- Monthly patterns and day-of-week variations were observed.

##  Results

The dashboard in Power BI includes:

- Hourly, daily, and monthly ride patterns
- Fare distribution charts (box plot, histogram)
- Peak vs. off-peak ride comparison
- Distance and fare relationship
- Filters for day of week and time

These charts helped identify patterns that arenâ€™t visible in tables.

## Conclusion

The cleaned Uber dataset revealed clear trends in ride behavior. Ride volumes peak during commute times, and fare amounts reflect both time and distance. Visualizations helped bring these patterns to life.

Python was used to prepare the data and create features, while Power BI made it easy to interact with and explain the insights.

##  Recommendations

- Focus promotional offers during low-demand hours
- Monitor peak time pricing policies
- Use time-of-day patterns to optimize driver dispatching
- Collect more data (e.g., weather, traffic) for deeper insights
